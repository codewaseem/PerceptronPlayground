## Introduction to Deep Learning


### What it is used for?
Everywhere. From things like beating humans in a game, detecting spam in emails, forecasting stock prices, image recognition, diagnosing illnesses - sometimes with more precision that doctors, self-driving cars, etc.

### What is deep learning?
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with the algorithms which simulates the function of a brain using artifical neural networks.


### Neural Network

Neural network is the heart of deep learning, it mimicks the process of a brain. A simple neural network is just an object which finds the best line that seperates two data points. Like finding out whether an email is spam or not, here there are only two possiblities, either the email is spam or not. In this case the data-set is simple and simple neural networks may do the job. But in more complex data-sets, we need deep neural networks, i.e combination and layers of simple neural networks.
